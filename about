javaml has a huge scope for newbies who want to enter the world of Machine Learning. Though there are more advanced and focus stuff like R,I think javaml is comparatively easy to grasp. 
Unfortunately,with lack of documentation and projects,it does not attract many programmers. Lets try to cover as many topics as we can.


Requirements : 

1) Tomcat server
2) javaml libraries


Make sure that all jar libraries are in WEB-INF/lib folder of your server . 
All java files should be in WEB-INF/classes/project folder. Here the package name is "project". The .jsp must deploy easily then if all directories are correctly placed.


Yet to add :-
1) Comments on what is happening where .
2) Bring movie names ,genre and images by extending the database. 
3) Security to the webpage.
4) Add new inputs from user to the training dataset.
